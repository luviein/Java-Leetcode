for i = 0 ,new entry will be 1 , 0 where the value is the placeholder
for i = 1, new entry will be 2 , 1. (5 is not equal to existing 1)
for i = 2 , new entry will be 4, 2. (3 is not equals to existing 2)
for i = 3, if loop will become true cos diff 2 is equals to existing entry of 2,1
so i will put in the value of 3 (index) into the 2,1 map
